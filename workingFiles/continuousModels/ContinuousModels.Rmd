Fitting models of continuous character evolution
========================================================

Let's fit some models of continuous character evolution. First, we will learn how to do some tests of "phylogenetic signal," a very common test especially for ecological analyses. Then we will learn how to fit a series of evolutionary models for continuous characters.

```{r}
library(geiger)
library(picante)
library(phytools)
```

We will use the same anolis data and phylogenetic tree from previous exercises. If you don't already have them, you can download the files from the following addresses:

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9R4DAZPUvjiV2VhTUxOTlRuQUU/edit?usp=sharing">anolisDataAppended.csv</a> <br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9R4DAZPUvjiSkl1aFY2TkNMVFk/edit?usp=sharing">anolis.phy</a>

If you need to, make sure these files are in your working directory and read them in.

```{r}
anoleData<-read.csv("anolisDataAppended.csv", row.names=1)
anoleTree<-read.tree("anolis.phy")
```

If you have the data, then the following commands should work:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(anoleTree)
name.check(anoleTree, anoleData)
```

Let's do the two main tests for phylogenetic signal using anole body size. The first test is Blomberg's K, which compares the variance of PICs to what we would espect under a Brownian motion model. K = 1 means that relatives resemble one another as much as we should expect under BM; K < 1 means that there is less "phylogenetic signal" than expected under BM, while K > 1 means that there is more. A significant p-value returned from phylosignal tells you that there is significant phylogenetic signal - that is, close relatives are more similar than random pairs of species. 

```{r}
anoleSize<-anoleData[,1]
names(anoleSize)<-rownames(anoleData)
phylosignal(anoleSize, anoleTree)
phylosig(anoleTree, anoleSize, method="K", test=T)
```

Another method for testing phylogenetic signal is Pagel's lambda. Lambda is a tree transformation that stretches tip branches relative to internal branches, making the tree more and more like a complete polytomy. If our estimated lambda = 0, then the traits are inferred to have no phylogenetic signal. Lambda = 1 corresponds to a Brownian motion model; 0 < lambda < 1 is in between.


```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
# First let's look at what lambda does
anoleTreeLambda0<-rescale(anoleTree, model="lambda", 0)
anoleTreeLambda5<-rescale(anoleTree, model="lambda", 0.5)

par(mfcol=c(1,3))
plot(anoleTree)
plot(anoleTreeLambda5)
plot(anoleTreeLambda0)

phylosig(anoleTree, anoleSize, method="lambda", test=T)

lambdaModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize, model="lambda")
brownianModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize)
nosigModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTreeLambda0, anoleSize)

lambdaModel$opt$aicc
brownianModel$opt$aicc
nosigModel$opt$aicc

# Conclusion: Brownian model is best, no signal model is terrible
```

We can use fitContinuous to fit OU and EB models as well.

```{r}
brownianModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize)
OUModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize, model="OU")
EBModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize, model="EB")

# inspect results
brownianModel
OUModel
EBModel

# calculate AIC weights
bmAICC<-brownianModel$opt$aicc
ouAICC<-OUModel$opt$aicc
ebAICC<-EBModel$opt$aicc

aicc<-c(bmAICC,ouAICC, ebAICC)
aiccD<-aicc-min(aicc)
aw<-exp(-0.5 * aiccD)
aiccW<-aw/sum(aw)
aiccW
```

It is important to realize that measurement error can bias your inferences with fitting these models towards OU. Fortunately, we can easily account for that in fitContinuous.

```{r}

# We measured 20 anoles per species, and the standard deviation within each species was, on average, 0.05
seSize<-0.05 / sqrt(20)

# redo with measurement error
brownianModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize, SE=seSize)
OUModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize, model="OU", SE=seSize)
EBModel<-fitContinuous(anoleTree, anoleSize, model="EB", SE=seSize)


# calculate AIC weights
bmAICC<-brownianModel$opt$aicc
ouAICC<-OUModel$opt$aicc
ebAICC<-EBModel$opt$aicc

aicc<-c(bmAICC,ouAICC, ebAICC)
aiccD<-aicc-min(aicc)
aw<-exp(-0.5 * aiccD)
aiccW<-aw/sum(aw)
aiccW
```
